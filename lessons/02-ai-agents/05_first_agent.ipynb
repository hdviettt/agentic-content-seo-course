    "\n",
    "An **AI agent** is a program that can **think** and **respond** — like a smart assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine hiring a new employee:\n",
    "- You **give them a name** (name)\n",
    "- You **choose their brain** (model — here it's Claude)\n",
    "- You **write their job description** (instructions)\n",
    "- Then you **assign tasks** and they get to work (run)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly how an AI agent works!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll:\n",
    "1. Create our first AI agent\n",
    "2. Send it a message\n",
    "3. Change the agent's behavior with `instructions`"

   "source": "## Basic Agent Structure\n\nAn agent in Agno has 3 main components:\n\n```python\nAgent(\n    name=\"...\",          # The agent's name\n    model=Claude(...),    # The brain — which AI model does the thinking\n    instructions=[...],   # Job description — how the agent should behave\n)\n```\n\n- **`name`**: An identifier for the agent. Like an employee's name.\n- **`model`**: Which AI model does the thinking. We use Claude Sonnet.\n- **`instructions`**: A list of directives. Like writing a job description for a new hire.\n\n> **Cost note:** From this lesson onward, cells that call `agent.run()` make API calls that cost money (~$0.01-0.05 per call for Sonnet). Run each cell once to see the result — avoid re-running unnecessarily."
