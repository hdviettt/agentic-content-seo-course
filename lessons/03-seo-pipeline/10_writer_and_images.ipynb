All files in the `content/` folder are Markdown (`.md`) files.\n\nHere's how Markdown works:\n\n| What you type | What it looks like |\n|---|---|\n| `# Title` | Big heading (H1) |\n| `## Section` | Medium heading (H2) |\n| `### Subsection` | Small heading (H3) |\n| `**bold text**` | **bold text** |\n| `- item` | Bullet point |\n| `1. item` | Numbered list |\n| `[link text](url)` | Clickable link |\n| `![alt text](image-url)` | An image |\n\n**Why Markdown?**\n- It's plain text — easy to store, version, and process in code\n- It converts to HTML for websites with one command\n- It's the standard format for content management systems\n- You're reading Markdown right now — this notebook uses it for the text cells!",

    "\n",
    "Grok has one **important limitation**: it cannot use `tools` and `output_schema` at the same time. So:\n",
    "- Writer Agent has **no tools** — it only receives text and writes\n",
    "- Writer Agent has **no output_schema** — it returns plain Markdown directly\n",
