An API call fails, a search returns nothing, or the network drops.\n\nPython uses **try/except** to handle errors gracefully:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Try running this code\n    result = agent.run(\"...\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # If it fails, do this instead\n    print(f\"Something went wrong: {e}\")\n```\n\n- Code inside `try` runs normally\n- If any line inside `try` fails, Python **jumps** to `except` immediately\n- The variable `e` contains the error message\n- Without try/except, the whole program would crash\n\nOur pipeline wraps all 4 agent steps in try/except. If any step fails:\n1. The error message is saved to the database (`error_message` column)\n2. The article status changes to `\"error\"`\n3. The pipeline stops and returns `False`\n\nThis means **one failing article doesn't crash the whole batch** — other articles continue processing normally.\n\n> **Cost:** The next cell runs the full pipeline (~$1-3 per run: Sonnet for research + outline, Grok for writing). Takes 2-4 minutes. Run it once.",
